# Local_Logins
Local Password Manager

This is a simpllistic, text based password manager. Coded in Java and makes use of Linked lists to keep all login info organized.

I developed this with the purpose of replacing the password manager that I had previously used. This is to avoid the premium cost that big services demand.

Local Logins contains all the essential features a password manager needs. Logins are contained on a text file that the program produces, or you can search for specific login information in the program itself.

Thanks for checking out my program!
